## The Game play
The Game allows up to `2 players` at a time .  the two palyers take turns playing the game , first the type their initials and they're ready to go . Each player has up to `8 misses` at a time so he/she better shoots precisely . the game has `3 levels` , the player by default starts at `level 1` then after `2 hits` the game elvates to `level 2` where the balloon gets faster hence harder to shoot and if the player is clever enough to get `4 hits` the game reaches its final level where the balloon is the fastest .. **we dare you to score a hit in that level !**


While the player is playing , the highest score that's been reached within that series of games is shown so that is basically the score to beat .

After 8 misses the game over window is shown where a score table that shows the highest score of each player is shown and they can shoose which player to play next and that repeats for eternity .
